NOTICE: profiles/ (experimental artifacts)

This directory contains experimental profile outputs created during an offline/profile-building experiment.

Key points:
- These files are artifacts: they were generated by an experimental script and are NOT used by the main RAG pipeline.
- Filenames may include model-generated summaries or partial JSON/text profiles. The outputs can be noisy or contain inferred values.

How to regenerate (if you understand the risks):
1. Ensure you have appropriate LLM credentials in a local `.env` (see project README)
2. Run the offline script (this may require significant compute/time and may call external LLM APIs):

   ```powershell
   python profile_builder.py
   ```

3. Inspect and manually validate outputs before relying on any values.

Safer alternatives:
- Use `ingest_data.py` + the RAG flow in `qa_system.py` for retrieval-based answers with explicit evidence provenance.
- Implement deterministic extractors (regex-based) for structured data (phone numbers, emails) when you need reliable facts.

Do NOT commit secrets or sensitive API keys into this folder. These files are provided for reference and reproducibility of the experiments only.
